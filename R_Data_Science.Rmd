# Tropical Storm Analysis Project

In this project, we'll analyze a dataset of tropical storms using R. We'll explore various aspects of the storms, including their frequency, intensity, and geographical distribution.

## Setup

First, let's load the necessary libraries and our data:

```{R}
```
```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

storms_data <- read_xlsx("tropical_storms.xlsx")
```

## Data Exploration
## Storm Count

Let's start by counting the number of unique storms in our dataset:

```{R}

num_of_storms <- storms_data %>%
  group_by(year, name) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  nrow()

print(paste("There are", num_of_storms, "storms in the dataset"))
```

This code groups the data by year and storm name, then counts the number of unique combinations. Each combination represents a distinct storm.

## Category 5 Storm Frequency

Next, we'll investigate how long it's been since the last Category 5 storm:

```{R}
last_year <- max(storms$year)
last_cat5_year <- storms %>%
  filter(category == 5) %>%
  filter(year == max(year))

print(paste("There have been", last_year-last_cat5_year$year[1], "years without category 5 storms"))
```

This code identifies the most recent year with a Category 5 storm and compares it to the latest year in the dataset.

## Storm Indexing

Let's add an index to our storms based on their name:

```{R}
storms_data <- storms_data %>%
  mutate(index = ifelse(str_sub(name, 1, 2) == "AL", str_sub(name, 3, 4), ""),
         index = as.numeric(index))
```

This creates a new 'index' column, extracting a numeric index from storm names that start with "AL".
Data Visualization

## Average Wind Speed by Category

Let's create a line chart showing the average wind speed for each category over the years:

```{R}
storms_data %>%
  group_by(year, category) %>%
  summarize(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = wind, group = category, color = factor(category))) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Average wind speed per year and category")
```

This visualization helps us see trends in wind speeds across different storm categories over time.

## Storm Characteristics by Year and Category

Now, let's create a summary dataframe with key storm characteristics:

```{R}
first_last_data <- storms_data %>%
  group_by(year, category) %>%
  summarise(maxwind = max(wind),
            pressure_diff = max(pressure) - min(pressure),
            share_below_30 = mean(lat < 30)) %>%
  print()
```
This dataframe shows the highest wind speed, pressure range, and proportion of observations below latitude 30 for each year and category.

## Latitude Changes

Let's identify which category had the largest increase in observations below latitude 30:

```{R}
first_year <- min(storms_data$year)
last_year <- max(storms_data$year)
highest_diff <- first_last_data %>%
  filter(year %in% c(first_year, last_year)) %>%
  select(year, category, share_below_30) %>%
  spread(key = year, value = share_below_30) %>%
  mutate(diff = get(as.character(last_year)) - get(as.character(first_year))) %>%
  filter(diff == max(diff))
print(paste("Category", highest_diff$category, "increased the most"))
```
This analysis helps us understand how storm patterns may be shifting geographically over time.

## Storm Category Distribution

Let's visualize the distribution of storms across categories:

```{R}
storms_data %>%
  group_by(year, name) %>%
  summarize(highest_category = max(category)) %>%
  group_by(highest_category) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(tot = sum(count),share = round(100*count/sum(count), 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(highest_category), y = share)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste(share,"%")), vjust = -0.5) +
  ggtitle("Share of highest category reached")
```

This chart shows the percentage of storms that reach each category level.

## Monthly Storm Patterns

Now, let's examine storm patterns by month:

```{R}
per_month <- storms_data %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(latitude = min(lat),
            highest_category = max(category)) %>%
  mutate(month = month(month, label = TRUE)) %>%
  print()

peak_season <- storms_data %>%
  filter(month >= 7 & month <= 9) %>%
  summarise(month = "peak season",
            latitude = min(lat),
            highest_category = max(category)) %>%
  print()
per_month <- bind_rows(per_month, peak_season)
```

This code summarizes storm data by month and identifies the peak storm season.

## Visualizing Monthly Patterns

Let's create a visualization of the minimum latitude reached by storms each month:

```{R}
per_month %>%
  mutate(type = ifelse(month == "peak season", 
                       "peak season",
                       ifelse(highest_category == 5, "With category 5", "Standard"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(month, latitude ), 
             y = latitude , 
             fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("Minimum latitude per month")
```

This chart helps us understand seasonal patterns in storm locations.
## Wind vs. Pressure Relationship

Let's examine the relationship between wind speed and pressure for each storm category:

```{R}
for (Category in unique(storms_data$category)) {
  cat_data <- storms_data %>%
    filter(category == Category)
  
  g <- ggplot(cat_data, mapping = aes(x = pressure, y = wind, color = lat < 20)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Wind vs. Pressure",
            subtitle = paste("Category", Category))
  print(g)
}
```
These scatter plots help us visualize how wind speed and pressure relate across different storm categories.

## Impact Analysis

Finally, let's conduct a hypothetical impact analysis:

```{R}
storms_with_radius <- filter(storms_data, hu_radius > 0)

wind_july <- storms_with_radius %>%
  filter(month == 7) %>%
  summarize(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  print()

november_data <- storms_with_radius %>%
  filter(month == 11) %>%
  mutate(damage = wind * hu_radius * hu_radius) %>%
  print()

november_data <- november_data %>%
  mutate(cf_wind = wind_july$wind) %>%
  mutate(cf_damange = cf_wind * hu_radius * hu_radius) %>%
  print()

print(paste("Total damage for August will be higher by", sum(november_data$cf_damange-november_data$damage)))
```
This analysis compares the potential damage of November storms if they had July's average wind speeds, giving us insight into the impact of seasonal wind speed variations on storm damage.
